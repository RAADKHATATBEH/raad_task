- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
Suppose my friend and I study at the same university 
and downloaded the Java course and each one at a different doctor.
 After taking the exam, my friend managed to get a mark of 20 out of 30 and I 
managed to get a score of 22 out of 30. We said that the average marks are different and we want 
to know which mark is better than the second So we have to calculate z_scor
```
- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
Make each test cases independent (It's important)
JUnit can do it: each time new test case instance will be created and @Before is called.
Separate testing code from source
JUnit can do it.
Integration with CI
JUnit can do it with Ant and Maven.
Arrange and combine test cases easily
Easy to check result
JUnit offers many Assert methods (assertEquals, assertSame...)

JUnit can do: Using mock and stub make you setup correct fixture, and focus on the test
Unit testing, a testing technique using which individual 
modules are tested to determine if there are any issues by the developer himself.```

Yes, I learned a lot from this task, how I did z score and min , scal
,write on the File,I got to know csv File, i learned the clean code ,
Maven files and what is their importance , how add
dependencies, learned a little Java 8 like Stream and I will learn more ?
